Inspired by Chris Phippen. After getting to know in more depth his uni experience and role within Hatless Studios, we discussed the implementation 
of quite some interesting secret data storage software that hides data within images by changing the last two bits of the rgb values, hence not 
affecting the visibility of the image to the user, but in tern being able to store quite some data.
